        Robert Greenberg founded ShopShoe in 1992. At the time, L.A. Gear had a lock on the women’s athletic market and Nike dominated the market for men’s athletic wear. But there were no industry giants who controlled men’s and women’s street shoes. This provided ShopShoe an opportunity to champion a new and expanding niche market in the U.S.A.

Before Greenberg went out on his own to create ShopShoe, he was one of the founders of L.A. Gear, which within seven years of business was already grossing more than $900 million in sales—the yield of neon tennis shoes that favored female preferences. By 1992, L.A. Gear saw a huge loss in market share and the company forced out Robert and his son Michael.

It wasn’t the first taste of the unpredictable, significant shift in the retail trade for Greenberg. He began his career in the 1960s and worked in various retailing roles: from selling wigs to beauty parlors to importing designer jeans to founding a roller skate store. But his first major break happened after he purchased the license to place the image of the film character E.T. on his shoelaces.
